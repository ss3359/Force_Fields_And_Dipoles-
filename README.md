# Force_Fields_And_Dipoles
This Python project visualizes the magnetic field of a dipole and the resulting Lorentz force field acting on a moving charged particle in 3D space. 

## Features
3D vector field visualization using matplotlib

Simulation of a magnetic dipole field in free space

Computation of Lorentz force vectors using the cross product F = q(v × B)

Highly customizable: dipole direction, particle velocity, grid size, and more

## Getting Started
Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required packages:
pip install numpy matplotlib

## Physics Background
The magnetic field of a dipole is given by:

B = (μ₀ / 4π) × [ (3(m·r)r − m|r|²) / |r|⁵ ]

The Lorentz force on a moving charge is:

F = q(v × B)
